        <p class="my-desc">I am a user interface developer, currently living in Boryspil, a town on the outskirts of
            Kyiv
            (Ukraine).
            I like the idea of ​​working in a team, I think it's a way to learn new skills and bring your knowledge to
            the
            team to improve productivity in developing a digital product. I enjoy discovering new things every day and
            being
            a valuable asset to any team I work in, so I'm constantly learning and exploring new trends.
            I try to get as much feedback on projects as possible to improve and create projects that are not only
            aesthetically pleasing, but also accessible and functional, so I like to work closely with stakeholders.
